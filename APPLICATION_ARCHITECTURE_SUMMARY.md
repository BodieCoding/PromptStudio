# Application Architecture Collaboration: Visual Builder Domain Architecture

## Executive Summary

As both data architect and application architect, I've collaborated to design a comprehensive domain model that addresses the critical gaps for enterprise-grade visual workflow capabilities in PromptStudio. This architecture supports the ambitious LLMOps platform vision outlined in the project plan.

## Critical Questions Answered

### 1. **Template-Execution Traceability** ✅
**Question**: "If a prompttemplate is used to make a node, then is executed, how is it associated to the execution history or the prompttemplate itself?"

**Solution**: Complete end-to-end traceability through multiple relationships:
```
PromptTemplate → WorkflowTemplateUsage → FlowNode → NodeExecution → PromptExecution
```

**Implementation**:
- `WorkflowTemplateUsage` tracks which templates are used in which workflows/nodes
- `NodeExecution.PromptTemplateId` + `NodeExecution.PromptExecutionId` provides direct linkage
- `NodeExecution.TemplateVersion` ensures version-specific tracking
- Template performance can be analyzed both standalone and within workflow contexts

### 2. **Workflow Organization** ✅
**Question**: "The visual workflows should be stored in a similar library collection as prompt library"

**Solution**: `WorkflowLibrary` entity with identical organizational structure to `PromptLibrary`:
- Same hierarchical organization within PromptLabs
- Identical permission and sharing systems
- Category-based organization
- Tag-based discovery
- Sort order and pinning capabilities

### 3. **Performance Monitoring & A/B Testing** ✅
**Question**: "How will Workflow components built in the visual builder be monitored and compared for performance and tweaked and tested?"

**Solution**: Multi-layered analytics and experimentation framework:
- **FlowVariant**: A/B testing with statistical significance tracking
- **ExecutionMetric**: Custom metrics for detailed analytics
- **NodeExecution**: Individual node performance tracking
- **FlowExecution**: Workflow-level performance and cost analysis

### 4. **AI-Assisted Development** ✅
**Question**: "What if I wanted AI to help make a flow?"

**Solution**: Comprehensive AI assistance framework:
- `WorkflowSuggestion`: AI-generated optimization suggestions
- `FlowGenerationContext`: Natural language to workflow conversion
- AI confidence scoring and reasoning context
- Continuous improvement suggestions based on execution data

### 5. **Storage Strategy** ✅
**Question**: "Is relational the best for this design?"

**Solution**: **Hybrid Approach** - Best of both worlds:
- **Relational structure** for workflow topology (nodes, edges, relationships)
- **JSON storage** for flexible node configurations and complex data
- **Optimized querying** on relational structure while maintaining flexibility
- **Performance** through proper indexing and partitioning strategies

## Enhanced Domain Architecture

### Core Workflow Entities
```
PromptLab
├── WorkflowLibrary (organizational structure)
│   ├── PromptFlow (individual workflows)
│   │   ├── FlowNode (relational workflow structure)
│   │   ├── FlowEdge (connections between nodes)
│   │   ├── FlowVariant (A/B testing variants)
│   │   └── WorkflowSuggestion (AI optimization suggestions)
│   └── WorkflowLibraryPermission (access control)
└── PromptLibrary (existing structure)
    └── PromptTemplate (can be used in workflows)
```

### Execution & Analytics
```
FlowExecution (workflow execution instance)
├── NodeExecution (individual node executions)
│   ├── PromptTemplateId (template traceability)
│   ├── PromptExecutionId (complete execution linkage)
│   └── TemplateVersion (version tracking)
├── ExecutionMetric (custom analytics)
└── WorkflowTemplateUsage (template usage tracking)
```

### AI-Assisted Development
```
WorkflowSuggestion (AI optimization suggestions)
├── SuggestionType (performance, cost, quality, etc.)
├── AiModel & ConfidenceScore (AI context)
├── ExpectedImpact (predicted improvements)
└── ActualImpact (measured results)
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Hybrid Storage Strategy**
- **Relational**: Nodes, edges, executions, metrics (queryable structure)
- **JSON**: Node configurations, complex data, flexible schemas
- **Benefits**: Performance + flexibility + analytics capability

### 2. **Complete Traceability Chain**
```
User Action → FlowExecution → NodeExecution → PromptExecution → PromptTemplate
                ↓
         Template Usage History + Performance Analytics
```

### 3. **Enterprise-Grade Features**
- Multi-tenant data isolation (`OrganizationId` on all entities)
- Comprehensive audit trails (inherits from `AuditableEntity`)
- Soft delete support for compliance
- Optimistic concurrency control for collaboration
- Data classification and retention policies

### 4. **Advanced Analytics Architecture**
- **Real-time**: Individual execution tracking
- **Aggregated**: Performance summaries and trends
- **Comparative**: A/B testing with statistical significance
- **Predictive**: AI-powered optimization suggestions

## Implementation Advantages

### For Visual Builder Development
1. **Rich metadata** for UI rendering (node positions, colors, icons)
2. **Version control** built into domain model
3. **Real-time collaboration** support through optimistic locking
4. **Undo/redo capability** through comprehensive audit trails

### For Enterprise Adoption
1. **Multi-tenancy** ready from day one
2. **Compliance support** through data classification and retention
3. **Performance analytics** for cost optimization
4. **Security** through non-enumerable GUIDs and access controls

### For AI Integration
1. **Rich context** for AI assistance through execution history
2. **Feedback loops** for continuous improvement
3. **Template intelligence** through usage pattern analysis
4. **Automated optimization** through suggestion framework

## Database Performance Strategy

### Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX IX_FlowExecution_FlowId_Status ON FlowExecution(FlowId, Status);
CREATE INDEX IX_NodeExecution_TemplateId_Version ON NodeExecution(PromptTemplateId, TemplateVersion);
CREATE INDEX IX_ExecutionMetric_Name_Timestamp ON ExecutionMetric(MetricName, MetricTimestamp);

-- Analytics indexes
CREATE INDEX IX_FlowExecution_CreatedAt_Cost ON FlowExecution(CreatedAt, TotalCost);
CREATE INDEX IX_NodeExecution_NodeId_Performance ON NodeExecution(NodeId, ExecutionTimeMs, Cost);
```

### Partitioning Strategy
```sql
-- Partition execution tables by date for performance
ALTER TABLE FlowExecution PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(CreatedAt));
ALTER TABLE NodeExecution PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(CreatedAt));
ALTER TABLE ExecutionMetric PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(MetricTimestamp));
```

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Immediate)
1. Implement `AuditableEntity` base class
2. Create `WorkflowLibrary` and enhanced `PromptFlow`
3. Implement basic `FlowNode` and `FlowEdge` entities

### Phase 2: Execution Engine (Next Sprint)
1. Enhanced `FlowExecution` with full traceability
2. Template usage tracking
3. Basic performance metrics

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Following Sprint)
1. A/B testing framework (`FlowVariant`)
2. AI suggestion system (`WorkflowSuggestion`)
3. Advanced analytics and reporting

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features (Final Sprint)
1. Advanced permissions and compliance
2. Data retention and anonymization
3. Multi-region deployment support
