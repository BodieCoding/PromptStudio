**Labels**: `technical-debt`, `priority:p0`, `architecture`

**Body**:
```markdown
## Problem Description
PromptService.cs has grown to 1,054 lines, violating the Single Responsibility Principle and creating a maintenance nightmare.

## Current State
- Single service handling all prompt operations
- 1,054 lines of code in one file

- Difficult to test and maintain

## Desired State
- Split into 4 focused services: IPromptResolver, ICollectionManager, IExecutionTracker, ICsvProcessor
- Each service <300 lines
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing and maintenance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create IPromptResolver service for template resolution

- [ ] Create IExecutionTracker for execution history
- [ ] Create ICsvProcessor for CSV operations
- [ ] Each service has <300 lines of code
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Unit tests added for each service

## Implementation Approach
