/// <summary>
/// Comprehensive lab performance statistics and operational metrics for dashboard and reporting services.
/// 
/// <para><strong>Service Integration:</strong></para>
/// Used by analytics services to provide complete lab health assessment, performance monitoring,
/// and operational insights for management dashboards. Aggregates data from multiple domain entities
/// to deliver executive-level lab performance overview with key performance indicators and trends.
/// 
/// <para><strong>Data Contract:</strong></para>
/// Contains pre-computed lab-wide statistics including content inventory, execution metrics,
/// user engagement data, and financial indicators. Provides both current state snapshots and
/// calculated performance indicators for comprehensive lab assessment and comparison analysis.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><strong>Service Layer Usage:</strong></para>
/// - Executive dashboard services use this for lab performance overviews
/// - Comparison services analyze multiple labs using these standardized metrics
/// - Monitoring services track lab health and usage trends over time
/// - Reporting services generate executive summaries and KPI reports
/// - Capacity planning services use these metrics for resource allocation decisions
/// 
/// <para><strong>Calculated Properties:</strong></para>
/// SuccessRate is computed from execution data to ensure consistency
/// Service layers should use calculated properties rather than recomputing metrics
/// 
/// <para><strong>Performance Considerations:</strong></para>
/// Statistics are pre-aggregated for dashboard performance
/// Consider caching these results with appropriate refresh intervals
